    <p>
      I am a young woman in tech who is interested in learning how to build
      efficient and aesthetically pleasing front end technologies for the world.
      I’d describe myself as being very resourceful and ambitious at the same
      time. I find solutions, get creative, and solve problems without needing
      the help of coworkers or managers. I know when to ask for help and I don’t
      stay quiet if I do need assistance. But when it is possible to handle
      something without occupying the time of others, I do it and I consider
      myself very good at it.
